Entity Manager with Behavioural Attributes

There are several entity managers out there that are in use today.  We hope this one will be different because we expect
the entity manager to provide: 

1. Declarative Behaviours
2. Enginered and Auto Grouped Trees for navigation and access permissions
3. Rollups based on the trees with various aggrigations
4. Built-in comment, task and assignment tracking to allow in-app content reviews
5. Attachments to entities that can be used in building applications

For now this is pipe dream.
